=  Description:  =
==================
We have created few files: one for each class and one for the game-driver.
Implementing various functions in the classes and the game logic accordingly.
Each function parameters and return values is specified in the doc-strings.

=  Special Comments  =
======================
design decisions:
1) We have chosen to place most of the magic numbers in the game driver.
Therefore, its easy to manage the game parameter by a fellow programmer.
One could place the magic numbers wherever he desires, depends on his eternal implementation.
2) Our cross classes functions are defined in the main-driver, due to simplicity of code.
In opposing to defining a cross classes function internally (possible because we know all the classes priorly).
3) Our end of game messages are humorous in order to encourage the player through his endeavours.
One could also use a very serious format in itâ€™s messages to create a different atmosphere.
